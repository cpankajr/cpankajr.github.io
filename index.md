Hi!

I am a Final year student at [EXTC](https://www.sfitengg.org/EXTC.php) department, [St. Francis Institute of Technology](https://www.sfitengg.org). Currently, I am working on my final year project under a guidance of [Asst.Prof. Kevin D'souza](https://www.sfitengg.org/staff/FP_KevinD_EXTC_2016.pdf). 

My interests are in the intersection of Speech processing and Natural language processing, and broadly, to solve multimodal AI problems using machine learning techniques..
