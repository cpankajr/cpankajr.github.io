Hi!

I have recently completed my bachelor degree in EXTC engineering from [EXTC](https://www.sfitengg.org/EXTC.php) department, [St. Francis Institute of Technology](https://www.sfitengg.org), University of Mumbai, India.

I have done my final year project on [Harmony Search for Feature Selection in Speech Emotion Recognition](https://cpankajr.github.io/projects/) under a guidance of [Asst.Prof. Kevin D'souza](https://www.sfitengg.org/staff/FP_KevinD_EXTC_2016.pdf). 

My interests are in Affective Computing (mainly on Speech emotion Recognition) and Speech processing, and broadly, to solve multimodal AI problems using machine learning techniques.. 

For any query related to my projects or want just discussion on emotion recognition. you can contact [me](https://cpankajr.github.io/contact/)
