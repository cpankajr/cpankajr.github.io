My interests broadly lie in the fields of Speech Processing, machine learning and Signal Processing.
I recently got interested in understanding emotion from speech by using machine learning tools.


### Projects

* **Harmony Search for Feature Selection Speech Emotion Recognition**  
*Major Project, Ongoing*  
Guide: Asst. Prof. Kevin D'souza  
**Details:**  
Feature selection is a significant aspect of speech emotion recognition system. 
How to select a small subset out of the thousands of speech data is important for accurate classification of speech emotion.
The main aim of the project is to decrease computation time of Emotion Detection Mechanism by using less possible features while retaining significant accuracy.
- Extracted both MFCC and TEO-MFCC features from EMODB database on MATLAB
- Planned to apply Harmony search on these features to select more significant features. 
- Planned to develop a trained model for these selected features using SVM classifier

* **Speech Emotion Recognition using Dynamic Time Warping**  
*Mini Project II, Jan 2017 - Apr 2017*    
**Details:**  
The purpose of speech emotion recognition system is to automatically classify speaker's utterances into five emotional states such as disgust, boredom, sadness, neutral, and happiness.
- Designed and built a speech emotion recognition system using SAVEE database on MATLAB
- Developed a trained model for detecting emotion using DTW classifier
- Obtained accuracy of 68.57%

* **Electronic Piano**  
*Mini Project I, July 2016 - Oct 2016*  
**Details:**  
Built a piano with variable tuning feature using IC 555 in Astable mode.
IC sends high/low-frequency signals to a piezo buzzer based on the value of resistance corresponding to the key/button
pressed by the user thus producing the sound of the note. 
- Introduced potentiometers to obtain custom octave frequencies.

* **Line Follower Robot**  
*National Robotic Championship Organized by ARK tech in association with IIT Madras, Mumbai, India*  
*Vision (Sept 2015)*    
**Details:**  
The Line follower robot is a mobile machine that can detect and follow the line drawn on the floor.
- Built a robust line follower robot for a National Robotic Championship held at IIT Bombay.
- Programmed Arduino to control motors of robot.
